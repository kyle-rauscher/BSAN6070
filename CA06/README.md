## Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

The aim of this assignment is to perform customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm 
in order to better understand the different types of customers in a given dataset.

To acess this data,  'Mall_Customers.csv' dataset, use the EXACT URL in your code as data file location.

File Location: https://github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-Data/raw/main/CA06/Mall_Customers.csv


The Data Contains the Characteristics:

1. CustomerID: Unique ID for each customer
2. Gender: Male or Female
3. Age: Age of the customer
4. Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars
5. Spending Score (1-100): A score assigned by the mall based on customer
behavior and spending nature (higher scores indicate higher spending)

This program looks to achieve five overall tasks:
Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA),
Prepare the data for clustering,
Implement k-means clustering,
Visualize and analyze the clusters,
Write a report summarizing your findings

If you have any issues running the code, please contect krausche@lion.lmu.edu.
