## kNN based Movie Recommender Engine

If f we worked at Netflix, Hulu, or IMDb, we could grab the data from their data warehouse. Since we
don’t work at any of those companies, we have to get our data through some other means. We could use
some movies data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, IMDb’s data set, or painstakingly create
our own. In our case, we will use a small sub-set of the data extracted from the UCI’s IMDB data set.

To acess this data, Use the above EXACT URL in your code as data file location.

File Location: https://github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-Data/raw/main/CA05/movies_recommendation_data.csv

The data contains thirty movies, including data for each movie across seven genres and their IMDB
ratings. The labels column values are all zeroes because we aren’t using this data set for classification or
regression. 

First we look to build our own recommender system, then we look to test this by using the movie "The Post".

The Post is detailed with the characteristics:
IMDB Rating = 7.2, Biography = Yes, Drama = Yes, Thriller = No, Comedy = No, Crime = No,
Mystery = No, History = Yes
